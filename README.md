Notes on setting up OpenBSD as an Email server following the KISS principle.
You will get best practices from Ian F. Darwin, an OpenBSD developer since 1998.

OTOH, a book-length treatment isn't needed? In the interim, https://poolp.org/posts/2019-09-14/setting-up-a-mail-server-with-opensmtpd-dovecot-and-rspamd/ pretty much has you covered.

## Features: What are we going to build exactly ?

- PF (Packet Filter) will protect the box
- OpenSMTPD as MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)
- Dovecot MDA (Mail Delivery Agent)
- Spam fighting mechanism (Spamd/spf walk)
- DKIM sign outgoing mail
- System user accounts usage
- CLI (Command Line Interface) to manage the box
- Multiple domains hosting
- Easy monitoring
- A webmail with Let's Encrypt certificate
- Easy vacation message setup
- Chroot environment

## Prerequisites

- OpenBSD release 6.8
- DNS Records : A, PTR, MX, SPF, DMARC and DKIM
